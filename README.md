# Simon Game
The objective of the game is to repeat a series of random tile clicks created by the game. As you progress through the levels, the sequence becomes more longer and complex which makes it harder to remember.
The game consists of 4 different tiles, each with a unique colour and sound which is activated when pressed. The sound aids the player in remembering the sequence and the game ends if the player misses a step in the sequence.
